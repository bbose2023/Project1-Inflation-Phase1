# Project1-Inflation-Phase1
### Inflation Impact Insights in USA - Phase 1

# Project Title
## Examine the elements contributing to inflation and its impact on various sectors in the U.S. over the past decade or so.

# Description
Inflation affects nearly all aspects of the economy by driving up prices progressively. For this analysis, we utilized Jupyter Notebook to craft code with Python and its associated libraries. The current stage of the project is centered on examining how inflation is measured and the extent to which the Education, Housing, and Agriculture sectors influence inflation’s fluctuations, as well as the repercussions on these sectors themselves.

# Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Here’s a list of the packages and the command to install each one using pip, which is the package installer for Python:

**requests**: Used for making HTTP requests.
pip install requests

**pandas**: An open-source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools.
pip install pandas

**matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
pip install matplotlib

**plotly**: An interactive graphing library.
pip install plotly

**numpy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
pip install numpy

If you’re using an environment manager like Anaconda, you can also install these packages using the conda command instead of pip. Additionally, if you’re working within a virtual environment, make sure to activate the environment before installing the packages.

### Installation
Update the cpi_config.py and config.py files to add the API keys
Get a free Fred API Key at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
Enter your API in config.py
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
const FRED_API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';

### Execution
The entire project must be downloaded to your local machine. Within the project, you’ll find the Jupyter notebooks containing all the code, as well as the images generated from the analysis.

For an analysis of inflation’s overall impact and its computation, refer to the notebook titled with the prefix ‘**CPI**’.

To explore how inflation affects the Education sector, particularly college tuition fees, open the notebook beginning with ‘**Edu**’.

To examine inflation’s influence on the Agriculture sector, including the supply chain of agricultural products, use the notebook starting with ‘**Agri**’.

For insights into inflation’s role in the Housing sector, look for the notebook that commences with ‘**Housing**’.

### Result
